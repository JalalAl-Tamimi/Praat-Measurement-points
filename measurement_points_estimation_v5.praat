## 30 June 2004: original version. Based on Al-Tamimi (2004), JEP. Using Winsnoori. Max intensity picked in a 10 msec window.
## 1 May 2006: version 1: Adapted to Praat. Using normal pitch tracking and original implementation 
## 06 April 2009: version 2. Using normal pitch tracking, Point Process to estimate mean period duration. 
## 01 April 2011: version 3. A few updates and using To Pitch (ac) (for details, see Al-Tamimi and Khattab, 2015, JASA, 138(1): 344â€“360).  
## 25 May 2017: version 4. Using cross-correlation pitch estimate rather than autocorrelation (see Al-Tamimi and Khattab, under review, Journal of Phonetics, Special Issue on VOT) 
## 29 June 2022: Minor updates
## 20 October 2024: major update. Uses the latest update in Praat's pitch analysis
## Requires version 6.4 or above!



## The method starts by estimating the mean duration of a complete glottal cycle adapted to each speaker (the two-pass method).
## Then estimation of Intensity is based on Pitch minimum value estimated from the two pass method. The maximum intensity is obtained
## in a window with a length equal to the mean duration of a glottal cycle. 
## To allow for appropriate estimation of frame number, this implementation uses formant tracks to obtain the apporpriate position of frames.
## Two tiers are created, and results for even intervals are added on tier Pntl1 whereas the odd intervals are added on tier Pntl1+ to allow
## for non-overlapping points.
